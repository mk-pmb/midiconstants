midiconstants-csv
=================

An unofficial MIDI SDK that aims to provide data tables about (General) MIDI
in several formats:
  * CSV: semicolon delimited text files.
  * C++ header files via Python: see the section below.
  * Node.js package: Should work out of the box by reading the CSV files
    synchronously(!!) at `require()` time.
    If you want to use asynchronous module systems, use the JSON version.
  * JSON: You can use the Node.js version to generate a plain JSON file
    and an AMD-wrapped version in the `dist/nonfree/` folder:
    run `nodejs csv2pojo.js --dist-json`


Batteries not included :-(
--------------------------

This free software edition is a reboot of Torbjörn Rathsman's original
[`midiconstants` project](https://github.com/milasudril/midiconstants/)
and does not include the actual CSV data due to license issues.

Until we can find another source for these, you'll have to download
them yourself. One easy way to do so is to run:

```bash
$ ./build/download-data-files.sh
```

Data files
----------

The `data/` directory has:
  * `status_codes.csv`: All MIDI status codes.
  * `control_codes.csv`: All control codes for MIDI status `0xB0`.
  * `gm_programs.csv`: The names of all General MIDI programs
    ("instruments", "patches").
  * `gm_drumkit.csv`: The names of all General MIDI percussion sounds.


### Control codes
Control codes less than 32 have a corresponding Least Significant Byte control
code obtained by adding 32 to the Most Significant Byte control code.
Therefore, these are not listed in `control_codes.csv`.


## Usage
You may compile any include file by running the corresponding python script:

    python3 -- gm_drumkit.py output_directory [source_directory]

If source_directory is omitted, files are read from the directory in which
midiconstants' `compile.py` resides.
In addition to manually run the scripts, it is possible to use the project
out-of-the-box from a Maike enabled project. Thus, all include files can be
generated by running Maike from this directory, and all include files will end
up in the directory `__targets`.
